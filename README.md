## Feedster (jQuery Project)

### Description

I decided to complete this Codecademy jQuery project in my code editor rather than the online portal to get a more holistic understanding of the file and DOM linkage. I used the supplied source code and completed the steps using Github version control to commit documentation. Here is the project description:

In this project, I will help feedster add dynamic behavior to their website. They need help adding hover functionality to their navigation menu and buttons.

Feedster also wants help limiting their user's posts to 140 characters or less. Iâ€™ll need to use the jQuery documentation to figure out how to implement this using the jQuery keyup method.
